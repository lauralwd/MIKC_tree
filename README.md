This respository details our work towards placing _Azolla filiculoides_ MIKC genes in a broader picture of MIKC transcription factor evolution.
The phylogeny created here, is featured in \[publication\].
Many results made publicly available here, are intermediate results and should be treaded as such.
For the final results, please refer to the quick links listed below

### JuPy notebooks
This repository contains many JuPy notebooks in which we stepwise tried to get a better phylogenetic signal of MIKC evolution and interpretation of the placement of fern sequences.
Here I list very briefly the main conclusion or improvement for each of these files in their chronological order
